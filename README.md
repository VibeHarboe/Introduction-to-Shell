# Introduction-to-Shell
Hands-on Shell scripting exercises and tools from DataCamp's Introduction to Shell course — applied with real-world scenarios for data analysis and automation.

# 🐚 Introduction to Shell

**Repository:** Introduction to Shell – Data Analyst Portfolio  
**Training:** Data Analyst Career Track, DataCamp  
**Type:** Bash/Shell scripting for practical data workflows, automation, and real-world analytics

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through DataCamp’s *Introduction to Shell* course. All exercises, scripts, and project notes are reframed as real-world data tasks, with a focus on automation, data wrangling, and efficient analytics workflows.  
The goal is to demonstrate how shell scripting enhances my ability to preprocess, transform, and analyze data at scale in a business context.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Navigate, search, and manage files and directories via the command line
- Manipulate and process raw data efficiently with pipes, filters, and redirection
- Chain shell tools to build automated pipelines for repetitive tasks
- Apply batch processing to scale analytics and ETL workflows
- Develop and document custom shell scripts for business automation

---

# 💡 Real-world context:
Think of the shell and the file explorer as two different "languages" for communicating with your computer. Both ultimately control the same underlying processes – they just do so differently.

---

## File explorer (GUI):
  - Click to open folders
  - Drag to move files
  - Double-click to run apps

---

## Shell (CLI):
  - `cd /home/user/documents` = go to folder
  - `mv file1.txt archive/` = move file
  - `./app.sh` = run a script or program

---

## 💼 Real-World Scenarios

- Bulk renaming and organizing of data files for ETL
- Log file parsing for operational monitoring
- Batch data transformation before loading into SQL/BI tools
- Scheduling and monitoring of automated jobs
- Scripting custom utilities to bridge gaps in existing analytics workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills

- Bash / POSIX Shell
- Core command-line tools: `ls`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `sort`, `uniq`, `find`, `xargs`, etc.
- Scripting, permissions, and execution environment setup

---

> **Why Shell?**  
> Shell scripting remains a fundamental skill for any data professional working with large files, repetitive tasks, or cross-tool automation.
