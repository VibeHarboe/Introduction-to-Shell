# 💡 Real-world context:
Think of the shell and the file explorer as two different "languages" for communicating with your computer. Both ultimately control the same underlying processes – they just do so differently.

---

## File explorer (GUI):
  - Click to open folders
  - Drag to move files
  - Double-click to run apps

---

## Shell (CLI):
  - `cd /home/user/documents` = go to folder
  - `mv file1.txt archive/` = move file
  - `./app.sh` = run a script or program

---

# 🎯 Why this matters for Data Analysts:
Knowing both gives you flexibility. You can automate, batch process, and script operations in a way that GUIs can’t – crucial for data pipelines.
