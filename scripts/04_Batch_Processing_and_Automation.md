# 🚦 Batch Processing & Automation in the Shell
In this chapter, I explore how to automate repetitive tasks and efficiently process multiple files at scale using the Unix shell. You'll see how powerful it is to chain commands, work with variables, and run batch jobs—skills that are indispensable for real-world data engineering, ETL pipelines, and day-to-day productivity.

**Key Topics Covered:**
* Batch processing of files and directories with wildcards
* Automating workflows using shell variables
* Constructing robust pipelines for hands-free data wrangling
* Practical examples that mirror real business automation scenarios

This chapter is packed with actionable techniques and command-line tricks that can save hours of manual work, making you faster and more reliable as a data professional.

# 🌐 How I Print the Value of Environment Variables in Shell
When working with shell automation or batch processing, it’s crucial to understand how your environment stores information—especially when scripts rely on dynamic variables.

One common scenario: I often need to check what operating system type my pipeline is running on, or quickly fetch information about the user or session context. Instead of guessing, I use the built-in environment variables in Bash. These variables—like ```HOME```, ```PWD```, ```USER```, and ```OSTYPE``` — let me access everything from my working directory to the OS type, all programmatically.

### 📍 Real-World Task:
Suppose I need my script to behave differently based on the OS (Linux vs. Mac). I simply print the value using ```echo``` and the variable name, e.g.:

```echo $OSTYPE``` 

This returns:

```linux-gnu``` 

By including variable expansion (```$VARIABLENAME``` ), my scripts always “know” their context—making them portable and robust across platforms.

### TL;DR:
I leverage shell variables and simple commands like ```echo $OSTYPE``` to make my automation smarter and more adaptive—no more guessing or hardcoding platform specifics. 🚀

# 🛠️ Using Shell Variables for Flexible Automation
In my daily data workflows, I leverage shell variables to make scripts modular, repeatable, and easy to maintain—much like local variables in programming. Here’s a real-world scenario of how I use them:

### 🎯 Task Example: Dynamically Accessing Files with Shell Variables
Instead of hardcoding filenames, I assign them to variables, which allows me to switch datasets or rerun tasks without editing commands line by line.

```
# Assigning the filename to a variable for dynamic access
testing=seasonal/winter.csv

# Using the variable in a command for flexible file handling
head -n 1 $testing
```

**Output:**

```Date,Tooth```

### Why this matters:
Using variables in the shell reduces human error, makes batch processing easier, and allows for fast updates across multiple steps in a pipeline. This approach is crucial when automating repetitive data tasks or when running scripts across different environments and file structures.

### 💡 Tip: 
> Always use the ```$``` symbol when referencing a variable’s value (e.g., ```$testing```). No spaces before or after the ```=``` sign when assigning.

# 🔁 Looping over file types: Automating repetitive tasks in the shell
In this exercise, I’m building my shell automation skills by using loops to process multiple file types—something you often need in real data projects when batch-processing files or generating reports.

### 🌏 Real-world scenario
Suppose you want to automate processing for a list of file types, such as converting or validating document files. Instead of running a command for each type manually, you can use a loop to repeat your command for every item in the list.

Here’s a shell loop that prints each file type in a given list:

```for filetype in docx odt pdf; do echo $filetype; done```

**Output:**
```
docx
odt
pdf
```

### 🎯 Why it matters:
This approach makes it easy to scale your shell scripts to handle any number of file types or datasets, while keeping your code clean and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Using loops for automation is one of the most powerful (and overlooked) skills for anyone who wants to level up their shell scripting and batch processing.

# 🌀 Automating Tasks Across Multiple Files with Shell Loops
One of the core strengths of shell scripting is the ability to automate repetitive actions across entire directories—without ever needing to manually list filenames. In real-world data projects, this means massive time savings and fewer human errors.

#### 🧲 Example scenario:
Imagine I want to process every file in a directory, regardless of its extension, using a shell loop and a wildcard. Here’s how I do it:
```
for filename in people/*; do
  echo $filename
done
```

* The wildcard ```people/*``` expands to every file in the ```people``` directory.
* The loop assigns each filename to the variable ```$filename```, one by one.
* The ```echo $filename``` command then prints the name of each file (but in a real pipeline, this could just as easily be a data cleaning, conversion, or analysis command).

#### 🏆 Terminal output:
```people/agarwal.txt```

*(…or however many files exist in your people/ directory)*

### 🎯 Why this matters:
This pattern lets me automate data processing pipelines and ensure consistent results across hundreds or thousands of files—perfect for real-world analytics and batch processing jobs.

### 💡 Tip: 
> Always use variables and wildcards in loops for maximum flexibility and automation!

# 🗂️ Efficient File Handling with Shell Variables & Wildcards
Working with large datasets often means managing many files at once. To avoid repetitive typing and minimize errors, I use shell variables in combination with wildcards. Here’s how I do it in practice:

### 🌏 Real-world Task
Suppose I want to quickly store and process all seasonal CSV files in a project. I assign all filenames to a variable using a wildcard:

```files=seasonal/*.csv```

This expands instantly to include all relevant files, no matter how many are present.

### Looping Through Files Like a Pro
With the variable set, I can process each file in a loop—printing, analyzing, or transforming the data as needed. For example, to print all filenames:

```
for f in $files; do
    echo $f
done
```

#### **Output:**
```
seasonal/autumn.csv  
seasonal/spring.csv  
seasonal/summer.csv  
seasonal/winter.csv
```

This approach ensures that even as the file list changes, my scripts remain robust and flexible. No manual updates required!

### 🏆 Key takeaway:
Using variables and wildcards together is an essential automation trick in data engineering and shell scripting. It keeps code concise, maintainable, and ready for scale. 🚀
