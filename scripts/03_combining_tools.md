# üß© Combining Tools: Power Moves in the Unix Shell

The real power of the Unix shell is not just in single commands ‚Äî but in how easily you can combine simple tools to solve complex, real-world problems. This chapter is all about chaining commands, selecting relevant data, sorting, and removing duplicates ‚Äî essentials for efficient data wrangling and automation as a data analyst.

## ‚ú® What You‚Äôll Learn
* **Piping and Redirection**
  Seamlessly send output from one tool to the next for streamlined workflows.

* **Selecting Data**
  Combine ```cut```, ```grep```, ```head```, and more to get exactly the rows or columns you need.

* **Sorting Results**
  Use ```sort``` to order your data‚Äîby dates, numbers, or categories.

* **Removing Duplicates**
  Apply ```uniq``` after ```sort``` to ensure clean, non-redundant datasets.

* **Real-World Automation**
  Chain tools to automate repetitive data-cleaning or QA steps in analytics projects.


## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Scenarios
* Extracting top customer records from a CSV and emailing a summary‚Äîall in one line.
* Sorting log files by timestamp and finding unique error messages.
* Filtering, deduplicating, and summarizing millions of rows in seconds, before loading into Python or SQL.
