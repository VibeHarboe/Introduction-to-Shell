# 🗃️ Introduction to Shell – Chapter 2: Manipulating Data

**Theme:**  
While the first chapter focused on moving and organizing files and directories, this chapter is all about **working with the data inside those files**. Here, I use essential shell tools to search, filter, extract, and transform data efficiently—crucial skills for data analytics, automation, and reporting.

**Approach:**  
All commands and workflows are presented as practical building blocks for real-world data projects—not as isolated exercises, but as proven techniques for scalable and repeatable results.
