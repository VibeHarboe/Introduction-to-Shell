⚡️ Automation Patterns for Data Analysts
This guide collects proven patterns and real-world automation techniques using the Unix shell. As a data analyst, I rely on these patterns to streamline repetitive tasks, reduce manual errors, and build maintainable workflows—whether for daily reporting, batch processing, or quick troubleshooting.

1. Automated Daily Reports with Scheduled Shell Scripts
Automating daily or weekly reports saves hours and ensures consistency. By combining shell scripts with scheduling tools (like cron on Unix), I deliver fresh, reproducible analytics without manual intervention.

Example Pattern:

Store your report-generating logic in a script (generate_report.sh)

Schedule with crontab:

0 6 * * 1-5 bash /home/user/scripts/generate_report.sh
