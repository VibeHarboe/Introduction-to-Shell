# 🐚 Getting Started with the Unix Shell
Welcome to my data analyst's guide to the Unix Shell!
This quickstart is designed for analysts, scientists, and tech profiles who want to move beyond clicking and dragging—and start automating and optimizing data workflows.

---

## 🚀 Why Learn Shell as a Data Analyst?
Automation: Replace repetitive manual tasks with scripts that run in seconds.

* Scale: Batch process, rename, and transform hundreds of files—without opening Excel.
* Portability: The same commands work on Mac, Linux, and most cloud servers.
* Transparency: Every step in your workflow is documented and reproducible.

## 💡 Key Concepts Introduced
Navigating file systems with cd, ls, pwd

* Viewing and managing data files directly from the terminal
* Combining simple commands into powerful pipelines
* Writing scripts for automation, cleaning, and reporting
* Debugging and error handling for robust workflows

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need
A Unix-based system (Mac, Linux, or WSL on Windows)

* Terminal or shell access (e.g., Terminal app, Git Bash, or WSL)
* Sample data files (see scripts/ for examples)
* [Optional] A text editor like nano, vim, or VS Code for editing scripts

## 👩‍💻 How This Guide is Structured
Each section in docs/ is designed to build your real-world shell skills step-by-step:

* Real-world workflows (automation, batch renaming, data cleaning)
* Best practices & pitfalls
* Practical mini-guides for advanced automation
* FAQ & troubleshooting—answers from actual data projects

All code examples are taken directly from my own data analytics training and project work.
